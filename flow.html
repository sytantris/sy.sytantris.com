      <p>I am a performer and eternal student of flow arts such as LED and fire poi, staff, hula hoop and flow wand. I first picked up a set of poi in the summer of 2007 and spent those sunny months carrying my poi everywhere, practicing at any opportunity I could get. I learned the basics quickly and moved on to more complex, technical tricks as well as learning to integrate them into and transition between them as a flowing dance.</p>
      <p>I began performing LED poi at psytrance events as <a href='http://www.facebook.com/sytantris.divinitryx' target='_blank'>Sytantris Divinitryx</a> in the beginning of 2016 and have booked myself solid with performance gigs throughout the spring. I bring to the stage the magic of flowing light, dance and technical skill to entrance the crowd and enhance the audio-visual experience, alternating with gogo dancing to help pump up the crowd. Recently I have also started to teach myself the flow wand, a magical-looking wand which appears to levitate by only the movement of one's hands, and once I am fully comfortable I will begin to integrate flow wand into my performances.</p>
