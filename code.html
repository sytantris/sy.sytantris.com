      <p>I've always had a mathematical, problem-solving mind, and my informal forays into the world of programming started early - as a child I remember programming small user interfaces in a language/platform whose name I no longer remember, and as a teenager I became an IRC 'script kitty', writing bots to live in our channels. I learned HTML and made countless websites throughout my pre-teen and teenage years. In my early twenties I decided to take an intro-level Java programming course in college. Programming came naturally to me - I was good at it, the assignments were enjoyably challenging but ultimately easy and fun for me.</p>
      <p>A few years passed and I always intended to learn more about it, but as it tends to go with life, things got in the way - work, school, travel, relationships, activities. But the bug had bitten me, it was only a matter of time, and one day, dissatisfied my customer service job and dating a programmer, I asked my partner what language he'd recommend learning. He suggested Ruby, and I fell in love. I spent my lunch breaks reading tutorials, my weekends with my head buried in my laptop hacking away at whatever problem I was working on while my roommates watched reality shows.</p>
      <p>As my skills and passion grew it became apparent to me that I would benefit from some more higher education on the subject, so I enrolled at Langara College in several university-level programming and web development courses. I spent a grueling school year doing basically nothing but programming and that summer was offered my first contract development job developing the MVP for a niche-based social network, using a stack I was completely unfamiliar with - platforms not known for their ease of use, such as Pyramid and Angular.js. Soon after that, I was accepted as the junior developer at a client-driven development company where I integrated the front-end designs, and increasingly began working on the Rails/Refinery backend, for a number of websites. I spent about a year and a half with this company before taking a hiatus in order to return to school to pursue my musical dreams.</p>
      <p>I am well-versed in front-end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, SASS &amp; LESS, Javascript and jQuery, since that is where the majority of my work experience lies. However, my skills do not limit me to front-end work - I have experience working in Rails, RefineryCMS and LocomotiveCMS as well. Additionally, I've explored a variety of languages, including Ruby, Java, C++, Objective-C and PHP, which I have varying levels of mastery in. I also have a strong eye for web design and training in usability/user interface design.</p>
