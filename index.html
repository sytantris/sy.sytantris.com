      <p>Greetings humans. My name is Aurora Synchronicity, but I go by the pen name Sytantris Dyat.</p>

      <p>I am a web developer by trade, and a musician by dream. Educated in programming, web development as well as audio engineering and music production, I recently completed the Advanced Recording Artist program at <a href='http://www.harboursideit.com'>Harbourside Institute of Technology</a> in North Vancouver, BC.</p>

      <p>I am a skilled front-end developer with UX/UI training and a keen eye for design. My education and work experience has left me skilled in tools such as HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery, with some experience with Angular.js as well. I also have experience working in back-end frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, as well as a variety of programming languages such as C++, Java, and mobile development for iOS with Objective-C.</p>

      <p>Musically, my main focus is my project Distant Whisper (which I produce with my partner <a href='http://www.soundcloud.com/tryptid'>tryptid</a>), an agenre lyrical electronic project that challenges the notion that electronic music with lyrics must by nature be cheesy. I also produce music under the moniker <a href='http://www.soundcloud.com/sytantris'>sytantris</a> and am an active up and coming DJ in the Vancouver psytrance scene <a href='http://www.mixcloud.com/sytantris'>under the same name</a>.</p>

      <p>I welcome you to explore my resume, development portfolio and links to my creative projects. Thank you for your visit!</p>
